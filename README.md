## 1.) Digital Logic & Embedded Systems Courses
 https://github.com/Ryanjwoodward/Digital_Logic-and-Embedded_Systems-Courses
  
####  a.) Intel: Digital Logic Course
    
> _Intel'a Digital Logic Course_, through FPGA Acamdemy, is an excellent introduction covering the fundamentals of digital logic design. I'am working through both the **VHDL** and **Verilog** Labs Furthermore it provided a strong foundation to binary arithmetic, boolean algebra, logic gate design (AND, OR NOT, XOR, etc). The course involved working with the number systems such as Bnary and Hexadecimal, implementing integrated cirsuits in an **FPGA** on the **DE10-Lite board**, and  design a variety of circuit such as Flip-Flops, Adders, Multiplexers, etc. 

      
####  b.) Intel: Embedded Systems Course
>_Intel's Embedded Systems Course_ through FPGA Academ provides an introduction to traditional programming of embedded systems using Linux. The course has an emphasis on I/O mehtodologies and the topics of the course include from memory-mapped I/O, Embedded Linux, Embedded Development, Kernel space & modules, interrupts, accelerometers, and working with audio and video perhipherals.

#### c.) Udemy Digital Logic Course
> Description of the course and what was involved here...
 
####  d.) circuits
> This Section of the repository contains all the circuits I have written using hardware description languages such as **Verilog** or **VHDL**. These circuits have been written for projects and courses i've taken. These circuits inlude Adders, Multiplexers, Decoders, Counters, Flip-Flops, and many others.
