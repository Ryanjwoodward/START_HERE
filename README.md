##  A.) Intel: Digital Logic Course
    
> _Intel'a Digital Logic Course_, through FPGA Acamdemy, is an excellent introduction covering the fundamentals of digital logic design. I'am working through both the **VHDL** and **Verilog** Labs Furthermore it provided a strong foundation to binary arithmetic, boolean algebra, logic gate design (AND, OR NOT, XOR, etc). The course involved working with the number systems such as Bnary and Hexadecimal, implementing integrated cirsuits in an **FPGA** on the **DE10-Lite board**, and  design a variety of circuit such as Flip-Flops, Adders, Multiplexers, etc.
