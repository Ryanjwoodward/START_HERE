  A.) Intel: Digital Logic Course
    
Intel'a Digital Logic Course, through FPGA Acamdemy, is an excellent introduction and covere the fundamentals of digital logic design.        Furthermore it provided a strong foundation to binary arithmetic, boolean algebra, and logic gate design (AND, OR NOT, XOR, etc).The course involved working with the number systems such as Bnary and Hexadecimal, implementing integrated cirsuits in an FPGA on the DE10-Lite board, and design a variety of circuit such as Flip-Flops, Adders, Multiplexers, etc. The Projects for each Lab are:
