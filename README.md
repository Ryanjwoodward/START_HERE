## 1.) Digital Logic & Embedded Systems Courses
> This Repository Contains Code, Documents, Circuit, and Project from many of the courses I've taken from a Digial Logic Course by Udemy and Intel, an Embedded Systems Course by Intel, Embedded Systems Classes at Grand Canyon University, and Microchips Embedded Linux, SoC's, and Embedded System Design courses

####  a.) Intel: Digital Logic Course
    
> _Intel'a Digital Logic Course_, through FPGA Acamdemy, is an excellent introduction covering the fundamentals of digital logic design. I'am working through both the **VHDL** and **Verilog** Labs Furthermore it provided a strong foundation to binary arithmetic, boolean algebra, logic gate design (AND, OR NOT, XOR, etc). The course involved working with the number systems such as Bnary and Hexadecimal, implementing integrated cirsuits in an **FPGA** on the **DE10-Lite board**, and  design a variety of circuit such as Flip-Flops, Adders, Multiplexers, etc. 

      
####  b.) Intel: Embedded Systems Course
>_Intel's Embedded Systems Course_ through FPGA Academ provides an introduction to traditional programming of embedded systems using Linux. The course has an emphasis on I/O mehtodologies and the topics of the course include from memory-mapped I/O, Embedded Linux, Embedded Development, Kernel space & modules, interrupts, accelerometers, and working with audio and video perhipherals.

#### c.) Udemy Digital Logic Course
> Description of the course and what was involved here...
 
####  d.) Circuits
> This Section of the repository contains all the circuits I have written using hardware description languages such as **Verilog** or **VHDL**. These circuits have been written for projects and courses i've taken. These circuits inlude Adders, Multiplexers, Decoders, Counters, Flip-Flops, and many others.
   
## 2.) Codebreaker Game 
> __Codebreaker__ is an _embedded systems project_ built on __Intel’s DE10-Standard Board using Linaro Linux, C, and Verilog__. The project simulates the game Codebreaker (aka Mastermind). The User is prompted by statements on the LCD screen and provides input via the pushbuttons. This project was designed and built for my embedded systems 1 course at Grand Canyon University.

## 3.) Poorman's ALU
> __Poormans ALU (PALU)__ is an _embedded systems project_ built on __Intel’s DE10-Standard Board using Linaro Linux, C, VHDL, Verilog, and Arm Assembly__. PALU is a simplified Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that can add, subtract, or AND two 4-bit inputs. This project required an extensive amount of planning and design including __K-maps, Truth Tables, Boolean Logic, and Schematic Capture__. For this project I implemented three __architecture models in VHDL namely behavioral, data flow, and structural__.

## 4.) Data Visualization Dashboard
> This Data Dashboard was the basis for my _Senior ‘Capstone project_ for _Grand Canyon University’s Software Engineering Program_. I had an opportunity to __intern with Paychex__ for two semesters as I developed the project. The Dashboard is designed to expose data stored in a relational database to the User Interface that supports a variety of functions such as sorting, filtering, paging, and data exportation (.csv). Further more I was tasked with building a __RESTful web service using Java and Springboot__ and a data management layer that leveraged __MongoDB’s Change Streams__ to maintain both Mongo Collections and the MariaDB schema.
